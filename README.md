# compilation-creator

Have you ever wanted to create your own compilation for YouTube, but don't have the video editing software to do so?
Here's your chance to make high quality compilations without paid software!

# Download
Follow this link to download the executable file: https://github.com/Ezonater/compilation-creator/releases/tag/v1.0.0

# How-To
The program is pretty self-explanatory, however I thought it would be best to still include a how-to guide
- Download the project [https://github.com/Ezonater/compilation-creator/releases/tag/v1.0.0]
- Unzip the file "compilation-creator.zip"
- Run "Compilation.exe"
- Follow the steps on screen
- Insert a title, a valid YouTube playlist, and an image to use
- Click the "Start!" button.
- Be patient! Compiling playlists of 25 or more will probably take an hour or two to render
- There is no progress bar, so again, be patient!

# Limitations
This program is pretty limiting. Here are some of the limits put in place as of 4/16/2021:
- You may only use one photo for the entire compilation
- You cannot choose the order of the tracks (to fix)

# Background
This program is made possible by youtube-dlc and ffmpeg.
