# Compilation++

Have you ever wanted to create your own compilation for YouTube, but don't have the video editing software to do so?
Here's your chance to make high quality compilations without paid software!

# Download
Follow this link to download the executable file: https://github.com/Ezonater/compilation-creator/releases/latest

# How-To
The program is pretty self-explanatory, however I thought it would be best to still include a how-to guide
- Download the project [https://github.com/Ezonater/compilation-creator/releases/latest]
- Unzip the file "Compilation++.zip"
- Run "Compilation++.exe"
- Follow the steps on screen
- Insert a title, a valid YouTube playlist, and an image to use
- Edit the settings either through the UI settings menu or the config.yaml file if needed.
- Click the "Start!" button.
- Be patient!

# Limitations
This program is pretty limiting. Here are some of the limits put in place as of 4/26/2021:
- You can only use one photo for the entire compilation
- You can only use youtube playlists (mp3 folders coming soon!)
- There may still be some bugs. Let me know at Ezonater#8586 if you discover any.

# Background
This program is made possible by youtube-dlc and ffmpeg. I do not benefit from this program whatsoever, I only created it to make compiling easier for everyone. I wish to see the community grow, so I hope this will help that happen.

# Thank you
I would like to thank the people who made testing this program possible!
